The file /forum-academy-mern/forum-academy-mern/client/public/videos/data1.mp4 is a video file and cannot be generated as text content. You should place the actual video file in that location. If you need to create a placeholder or indicate that the file is intentionally left blank, you can use a comment in the file system or documentation, but the file itself should contain the video data.
